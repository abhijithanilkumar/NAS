### Quick start

To set up a development environment quickly, first install Python 3.4. It
comes with virtualenv built-in. So create a virtual env by:

    1. `$ python3.4 -m venv NIT_Admission_System`
    2. `$ . NIT_Admission_System/bin/activate`

> Sometimes, binaries like pip get installed inside `local/bin/`. So append
> this line to `NIT_Admission_System/bin/activate`:
>
> `PATH="$VIRTUAL_ENV/local/bin:$PATH"`

Now the pip commands should work smoothly. Install all dependencies:

    pip install -r dev-requirements.txt

Run migrations:

    python manage.py migrate
